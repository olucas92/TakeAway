<h1> Takeaway Challenge </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
Week 2 challenge at Makers Academy, involving the use of a Twilio gem to send an automated text to the user when an order has been placed

<h2> Brief </h2>
 - Placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total.
 - If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the    order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was         placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
 - The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API.
 - Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
 - Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
 - Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested

<h2> Technologies used </h2>
 - RSpec
 - Ruby
 - Twilio

<h2> Still to do </h2>
 - Implement Twilio capabilities
 - Finish off the classes
 - Write more tests to make it more robust
 - Add more functionality, still pretty incomplete
